The $i$th order statistic is the $i$th smallest element of a set
median - half point 

### Selection Problem
Input - A set $A$  of $n$  (distinct) numbers and an integer $i$  so that $1 \leq i \leq n$ 
output - The element $x \in A$  that is greater than exactly $(i-1)$  other elements of $A$ 

### Selection in linear time
1. Divide $n$ elements to $\frac{n}{5}$ groups of $5$
2. Find median of each group by insertion sort
3. Recursively find the median $x$ of the medians
4. Partition around $x$ remove all smaller than $x$ , $k$ smaller and $n-k$ larger   
5. Find $i$th on the low side  if $i\leq k$  or on the high side if $i>k$
